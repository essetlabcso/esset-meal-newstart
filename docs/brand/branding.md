# ESSET Lab Branding (Build-Ready)
**Use this file as the single source of truth for UI styling, tone, and brand usage in Antigravity.**  
**Tagline:** Evidence-Powered Change

---

## 1) Brand essence (for UX + copy)

### Vision
<re.Match object; span=(753, 939), match='Vision A vibrant, equitable ecosystem where civil>

### Mission
<re.Match object; span=(932, 1105), match='Mission To co-create and scale adaptive tools, st>

### Core values (use as UX principles)
- **Co‑Creation:** design *with* CSOs/communities/partners.
- **Evidence That Matters:** prioritize useful evidence for decisions, not compliance-only reporting.
- **Adaptation & Learning:** normalize reflection, iteration, and course-correction.
- **Digital Simplicity:** low‑bandwidth, low‑literacy, accessible by design.
- **Justice & Rights:** power-aware, accountability-centered, safeguard-first.

---

## 2) Visual identity

### Logo meaning (narrative)
- Hexagonal layered “E”: depth, structure, system-building, and scaling.
- Sprout element: growth, learning, transformation, locally-led change.

### Logo usage rules (minimum)
- Prefer **full logo** on light backgrounds.
- Maintain clear space around logo (at least the height of the “E” mark).
- Do not distort, rotate, or recolor beyond approved palette.
- Use the logo icon alone only for app favicon / small badges.

---

## 3) Color palette (primary)
Use these exact hex codes:

- **ESSET Teal (Primary):** `#005F56`
- **ESSET Orange (Accent/CTA):** `#F4A026`
- **Charcoal (Text/Neutral):** `#2C2C2C`

### Usage guidance
- Teal: headers, primary buttons, nav highlights, links (when not orange).
- Orange: key CTAs, highlights, progress accents, selected states.
- Charcoal: body text, icons, secondary UI strokes.

---

## 4) Typography (web + app)

### Font families
- **Headings:** Montserrat (Bold)
- **Body:** Open Sans / Inter (Regular)
- **Mobile fallback:** Roboto

### Type usage (practical defaults)
- H1/H2: Montserrat Bold
- Body: Open Sans/Inter Regular
- Keep line length comfortable; avoid dense paragraphs for low literacy contexts.

---

## 5) Layout + UI style rules (build defaults)

- **Mobile-first** and touch-friendly (large tap targets).
- **Text-first** UI: minimal images; use icons sparingly to support comprehension.
- **Cards + sections**: use clear grouping, generous spacing, and simple dividers.
- **Low-bandwidth mode:** avoid heavy animations; keep transitions subtle.
- **Accessibility:** provide a “Simplify” toggle to hide advanced scoring details without changing recommendation order.

---

## 6) Voice & tone (copy rules)

Use a tone that is:
- **Strategic:** clear and analytical without jargon
- **Grounded:** practical and locally relevant
- **Inviting:** encourages action and ownership (“lead, adapt, transform”)
- **Respectful:** avoids donor-speak and avoids sounding like instructions from above

### Microcopy patterns
- Prefer “Let’s…” and “Choose what fits your context…”
- Avoid blame; emphasize constraints as normal realities.
- Keep labels short; explanations in collapsible help blocks.

---

## 7) Key message pillars (for onboarding + pages)
- **Don’t just report — learn and adapt.**
- **Evidence should be usable, not extractive.**
- **Tools must fit real constraints (time, literacy, connectivity).**
- **Learning culture is part of MEAL.**

---

## 8) Brand applications (implementation hints)
- Website/app should feel modular and clean; use teal for structure and orange for action.
- Documents/exports: consistent headings, small icons, strong white space.
- Facilitation packs: plain language, step-by-step, safety footers where relevant.

---

## 9) Antigravity implementation checklist
- [ ] Set CSS variables for the 3 hex colors
- [ ] Load Montserrat + Open Sans/Inter fonts
- [ ] Apply teal/orange button system (primary/secondary)
- [ ] Build mobile-first spacing + card layout primitives
- [ ] Ensure all screens remain readable under 2G constraints (no heavy assets)
