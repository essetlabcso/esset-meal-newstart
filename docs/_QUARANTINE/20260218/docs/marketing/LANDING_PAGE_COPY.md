# Landing Page Copy: ESSET MEAL

## Copy Rules
*   **No buzzwords**: Avoid "synergy", "paradigm shift", "revolutionary".
*   **Problem-First**: Always lead with the pain point.
*   **Mechanism-Driven**: Explain *how* it works in reality.
*   **Outcome-Focused**: End with the value for the decision-maker.

---

## 1. Hero Section
**Headline**: MEAL that works for the field, not just the donor.
**Subheadline**: Stop fighting with disconnected spreadsheets. ESSET MEAL connects your Theory of Change to real field data, giving CSOs the clarity to make decisions, not just reports.
**Primary CTA**: Start a workspace
**Secondary CTA**: See how it works

## 2. Reality Check (Pain Points)
*   **Spreadsheet Chaos**: "We have 15 versions of the same ToC, and I'm not sure which one reflects the current project reality."
*   **Compliance Fatigue**: "We spend 80% of our time capturing data for donor reports and 0% using it to improve our programs."
*   **The Field-Office Disconnect**: "I can't see what's happening on the ground until 30 days after the month ends."
*   **Hidden Assumptions**: "Our projects fail because we didn't track the assumptions that needed to stay true for our activities to work."

---

## 3. What ESSET MEAL Does (Current Realities)
*   **Unified Workspaces**: One home for your entire organization’s MEAL data.
*   **Projects**: Tenant-scoped project folders to keep your work organized.
*   **Analysis Snapshots**: Document your "Reality Checks" before you map your logic.
*   **Visual Theory of Change**: Build and iterate on your project logic with a drag-and-drop builder.
*   **Assumption Tracking**: Link specific risks and preconditions to every node and edge in your logic.
*   **Versioning + Publish Lock**: Immutable snapshots ensure everyone is looking at the same "truth".
*   **Invite Links**: Easily bring your team into your workspace with role-based invitations.

---

## 4. How it works (3 Steps)
1.  **Set up your workspace**: Invite your team and organize by project.
2.  **Map your logic**: Use the visual ToC builder to map activities to outcomes, and pin your assumptions.
3.  **Publish and Track**: Lock your logic into a versioned snapshot and start capturing field reality.

---

## 5. For Who (Personas)
*   **The Executive**: Clear, high-level dashboards for decision clarity across the portfolio.
*   **The PM**: Tools to plan, monitor, and report without the manual overhead.
*   **The MEAL Lead**: A structured engine to ensure quality standards and learning loops.
*   **The Field Team**: Simple, focused interfaces to capture what matters, when it happens.

---

## 6. Trust & Governance
*   **Data Integrity**: Immutable snapshots prevent "accidental edits" to published project logic.
*   **Tenant Isolation**: Your data never leaks. We use Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure project-level boundaries.
*   **Role-Based Access**: Control who can draft, who can publish, and who can view.
